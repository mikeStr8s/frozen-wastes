WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP EDITING MY WORK!!

I have been at this university for decades and no other professor has to deal with this much disrespect! Just because I add embellishments does not mean that this doesn't meet academic standard!

## Foreword by Professor Grunkle Blinkfizzle

_(Fellow of the Sylvanian Institute of Arcane)_

Ah! You’ve found it — my humble compendium of curious exploits, obscure creatures, and exceedingly brave (and occasionally foolish) souls. Splendid!

What you hold in your hands — or, more likely, on your glimmering scry-screen — is no mere storybook, dear reader. It is an _account_. A scholarly work! (Well, mostly scholarly. There are a few singed pages where a fire mephit took offense to my choice of adjectives, but such hazards are the price of proper fieldwork.)

In these pages I endeavor to record the true and terrible _Tale of the Frozen Three_ — a fellowship bound not by destiny (though it seems to have had an opinion on the matter), but by circumstance, courage, and a most inconvenient frost. You shall meet **Aronious**, the ranger who turned his back on the gods to chase redemption in the snow; **Bone**, a clever and wily kitsune rogue whose smile hides more than her daggers; and **Hobbins**, a wizard whose knack for mischief rivals his arcane prowess — heroes, villains, beasts, and beings best left unnamed before dusk.

Expect here a union of two disciplines:

- The **academic**, wherein I catalogue beasts, plants, relics, and ruins for the enrichment of the Sylvanian archives; and
- The **adventurous**, wherein I recount their deeds with as much accuracy as my ink and sanity can afford.

So! Read on, brave scholar or idle wanderer. Take notes if you wish (I do). Laugh when the absurd demands it, and tremble when the ice bites deep. Within these tales lie lessons on courage, folly, friendship, and the curious resilience of mortals when the world itself turns cold.

Now then — my tea grows tepid, and the yeti bones won’t articulate themselves. Let us begin.

With warmest regards and slightly frostbitten fingers,  
**Professor Grunkle Blinkfizzle**  
_Artificer, Researcher of the Arcane and Otherwise Curious_  
_Sylvanian Institute of Arcane, Department of Applied Curiosities_
