_Popular tavern_

The Wet Trout, located near the docks, is the largest and loudest tavern in [Easthaven](Easthaven.md), known for its ribald atmosphere and rumor-mongering. A great chimney squarely in the building's center has hearths on either side to warm the tavern's two common rooms. The tavern's current owner and proprietor is Nymetra Myskyn, a dragonbornÂ of white dragon ancestry.
