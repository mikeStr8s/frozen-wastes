_Inn_

This musty old inn is named after a local legend known as the White Ladyâ€”a ghost rumored to walk on Lac Dinneshere, haunting the spot where her rich husband drowned. Rinaldo, a self-styled bard kept around to entertain guests, is fond of plucking his fiddle while recounting his tale: that the White Lady's husband was a miser who kept his treasure in a heavy, locked chest that never left his side.
