## Heraldry

A snowflake at the top center of a steel-gray field, above a horizontal brown field that forms the left-hand base, and a dark blue field that forms the right-hand base; where they meet is a thin white tower. The brown field represents the Eastway, the tower represents the town, and the blue field is Lac Dinneshere.
