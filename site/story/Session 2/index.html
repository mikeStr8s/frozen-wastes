<h1 id="the-many-whispers-in-easthaven">The Many Whispers in Easthaven</h1>
<p>When the travelers returned to the <a href="../../world/atlas/Trail%27s%20End%20Tavern/">Trail's End Tavern</a>, the night was calm and cold, and the road behind them lay silent. Yet one thing was amiss — <a href="../../world/organizations/Torg%27s%20Trading%20Company/">Torg's Company</a> was gone, their sleds and dogs no where to be seen. Left while the part was away.</p>
<p>As they pondered their next course, the tavern door opened, letting in a gust of frost and a figure robed in rusty brown and red — <a href="../../world/characters/Dzaan/">Dzaan</a>. His eyes sparkled with curiosity rather than menace, and a hint of a smile tugged at his lips.</p>
<p>“Adventurers, by the look of you,” he said, striding to their table. “I’m conducting research on the elemental spirits that dwell in this land — <em><a href="../../world/creatures/Chwinga/">Chwingas</a></em>, I believe the locals call them. Elusive little things. I would pay handsomely for their study.”</p>
<p>Behind him, a companion in studded leather lingered at the doorway, but before the group could take a good look, the door shut and the figure was gone.</p>
<p>Dzaan placed a small <a href="../../world/artifacts/Lantern%20of%20Tracking/">lantern of gentle blue fire</a> upon the table. “This,” he explained, “is attuned to the spirits. It glows when they are near. Bring me one, and twenty-five gold is yours.”</p>
<p><a href="../../world/characters/Hobbins/">Hobbins'</a> eager chatter — and <a href="../../world/characters/Yin%20Shen/">Yin Shen's</a> foxlike grin — saw the wizard laugh and raise the offer. “A fine bit of negotiation,” he admitted, “and a sign of capable company. Thirty gold pieces it is.”</p>
<p>The party accepted and returned to the forest, lantern in hand. There, beneath the whispering pines, they sought to coax the Chwingas from hiding. Remembering the tales that the spirits were fond of childish wonder, the group began to dance, sing, and play at circles in the snow — ring around the rosy beneath the moonlight.</p>
<p>It was a comical sight: <a href="../../world/characters/Aronious/">Aronious</a> trying, with some dignity, to keep pace; Yin Shen spinning with genuine delight; and Hobbins darting through the snow like a ribbon of fur and laughter. Yet for all their effort, no spirit appeared. The lantern’s flame flickered once, then stilled.</p>
<p>With frost clinging to their cloaks and little gained for their play, they decided to continue their travels east to <a href="../../world/atlas/Easthaven/">Easthaven</a>.</p>
<p>By the time they arrived, the sky was black and heavy with snow. The lamps of <a href="../../world/atlas/The%20White%20Lady%20Inn/">The White Lady Inn</a> shone dimly through the storm — a welcome sight. Inside, warmth and music greeted them, and a bard named <strong>Rinaldo</strong> was making his rounds, filling the room with song and stories of the inn’s spectral namesake.</p>
<p>The trio took their rest there.</p>
<p>The next day as they warmed themselves by the hearth, a bard named <strong>Rinaldo</strong> approached — a man of quick fingers and quicker tongue — proclaiming that he would hold a <em>séance</em> to summon the spirit of the inn’s namesake, the White Lady who drowned long ago beneath the frozen lake.</p>
<p><strong>Yin Shen</strong> ventured into the square, where she stumbled upon a grim spectacle — <strong>Dzaan</strong>, the very wizard who had so warmly hired them, bound to a stake as the townsfolk gathered round. The flames climbed swiftly, and he met his end with unsettling calm.</p>
<p>Beside Yin Shen stood <a href="../../world/characters/Captain%20Imdra%20Arlaggath/">Captain Imdra Arlaggath</a>, the stern leader of Easthaven’s guard. Seeing her disquiet, the captain muttered, “Do not pity him, stranger. He murdered those he hired — folk of Icewind Dale — after they aided his travels. He’s reaping what he sowed.”</p>
<p>When the captain turned her questioning gaze to Yin Shen, the rogue answered plainly that she and her companions had only crossed Dzaan’s path briefly, and were in fact hunting <strong>Sephek Kaltro</strong>, the killer who had plagued Ten-Towns. Hearing that the murderer was no more, the captain’s demeanor softened.</p>
<p>“You’ve a sharp eye and a steady hand,” she said. “We’ve fishermen gone missing out on the ice. Find them, and what Dzaan carried in life shall be yours in death.”</p>
<p>The reward, as it turned out, included a <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spell%20Scroll">Scroll</a> of <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Fireball">Fireball</a> and a curious <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Bag%20of%20Tricks">Gray Bag of Tricks</a>, both lightly scorched from the pyre.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Aronious and Hobbins visited <a href="../../world/atlas/The%20Wet%20Trout/">The Wet Trout</a>, a lively and unruly tavern favored by miners and sailors. Hobbins, ever adventurous, sampled the local drink and promptly discovered the limits of a ferret’s fortitude — one glass of clear liquor was quite enough. She spent the evening regretting it, and the next morning regretting it still.</p>
<p>Aronious lingered at the bar, ever the quiet observer, and learned of other troubles. Between the shouting, dice, and spilled ale, he learned of a <strong>missing iron shipment</strong> meant for <a href="../../world/atlas/Blackiron%20Blades/">Blackiron Blades</a> of Bryn Shander. The dwarves bringing it from the mines at <a href="../../world/atlas/Kelvin%27s%20Cairn/">Kelvin's Cairn</a> had been attacked by a <strong>yeti</strong>, and the load lost in the mountains. The smiths offered gold for its return — and friendship besides, which for a dwarf is often worth more.</p>
<p>He returned to the inn that night, where Hobbins was recovering and Yin Shen shared what she had learned. Aronious raised an eyebrow at mention of Dzaan’s fate but said little. The wizard’s soul was no longer their concern.</p>
<p>As the night drew on, Yin Shen attended Rinaldo’s séance, curious to see what spectacle the bard would conjure. Aronious, wary of dealings with spirits, remained upstairs, tending to a restless Hobbins and the fire that kept the cold at bay.</p>
<p>Downstairs, the candles dimmed as Rinaldo began his performance, voice weaving through false prayers and soft illusions. Yet something unexpected happened — the air shifted, colder, real. The candles guttered, and from the center of the room a thin wisp of silver smoke coiled upward, forming the faint outline of a woman’s face.</p>
<p>Her whisper was no trick of thaumaturgy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em><a href="../../world/atlas/Caer-Dineval/">Caer-Dineval</a>.</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then she was gone.</p>
<p>Rinaldo, pale and trembling, ushered the guests out at once. Yin Shen lingered. A single glance from her foxlike eyes and a few sharp words were enough to draw the truth from him: his séances had always been <em>performances</em>, harmless illusions meant to entertain. But this time, what he summoned had answered him.</p>
<p>When she finally returned upstairs, the lantern Dzaan had given them hung by the window, glowing faintly in the dark. The Chwingas had not shown themselves — yet perhaps, in their own way, they had been watching all along.</p></div>
