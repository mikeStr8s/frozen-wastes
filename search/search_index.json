I have been at this university for decades and no other professor has to deal with this much disrespect! Just because I add embellishments does not mean that this doesn't meet academic standard! Foreword by Professor Grunkle Blinkfizzle (Fellow of the Sylvanian Institute of Arcane) Ah! You\u2019ve found it \u2014 my humble compendium of curious exploits, obscure creatures, and exceedingly brave (and occasionally foolish) souls. Splendid! What you hold in your hands \u2014 or, more likely, on your glimmering scry-screen \u2014 is no mere storybook, dear reader. It is an account . A scholarly work! (Well, mostly scholarly. There are a few singed pages where a fire mephit took offense to my choice of adjectives, but such hazards are the price of proper fieldwork.) In these pages I endeavor to record the true and terrible Tale of the Frozen Three \u2014 a fellowship bound not by destiny (though it seems to have had an opinion on the matter), but by circumstance, courage, and a most inconvenient frost. You shall meet Aronious , the ranger who turned his back on the gods to chase redemption in the snow; Bone , a clever and wily kitsune rogue whose smile hides more than her daggers; and Higgens , a wizard whose knack for mischief rivals his arcane prowess \u2014 heroes, villains, beasts, and beings best left unnamed before dusk. Expect here a union of two disciplines: The academic , wherein I catalogue beasts, plants, relics, and ruins for the enrichment of the Sylvanian archives; and The adventurous , wherein I recount their deeds with as much accuracy as my ink and sanity can afford. So! Read on, brave scholar or idle wanderer. Take notes if you wish (I do). Laugh when the absurd demands it, and tremble when the ice bites deep. Within these tales lie lessons on courage, folly, friendship, and the curious resilience of mortals when the world itself turns cold. Now then \u2014 my tea grows tepid, and the yeti bones won\u2019t articulate themselves. Let us begin.

Within the stout walls of The Northlook Inn , travelers gathered to warm their bones and share rumor. Among them that night were three figures who, by fate or folly, would soon be bound by blood and ice. First was Aronious , a man of quiet strength \u2014 a ranger who once bore the light of the gods, now dimmed by his own choosing. He had walked the lonely paths of the tundra, seeking the freedom of one. That one was Yin Shen , a fox-spirited trickster of celestial origin \u2014 fallen, imprisoned, and marked by the goddess Auril\u2019s endless Rime . Now fallen and bound to mortal flesh, her golden eyes and sharp grin betrayed a spark of the divine mischief that had once lit the heavens. And lastly, there was Higgens , scarcely taller than a sword, a ferret of remarkable intellect and no patience whatsoever. She claimed to be a wizard \u2014 and though many laughed, none laughed long once she\u2019d proven it. The three had scarcely entered The Northlook when their arrival drew the eye of Hiln Trollbane , a stout shield dwarf whose gaze carried the weight of suspicion and opportunity. When approached, she spoke of grim tidings \u2014 Over shared ale and cautious words, Hiln spoke of Sephek Kaltro , a blue-eyed killer she had stalked through Ten-Towns. He was said to be bound to Torg's Trading Company and to serve some darker purpose beneath the Frostmaiden\u2019s will. Sensing both coin and cause, the trio agreed to take up the hunt. They left Bryn Shander along the The Eastway , snow crunching beneath their boots and paws, until the lights of the Trail\u2019s End Tavern came into view. Within, the hum of travelers and traders mingled with the scent of wet wool and pine smoke. Aronious , ever cautious, circled the building, eyes sharp. He saw Torg\u2019s caravan settled within \u2014 ten rooms in all \u2014 and one, curiously, with its window unlatched and footprints fresh in the snow. Higgens , ever the opportunist, made herself scarce and soon reappeared with a few extra coins jingling in her pouch. Yin Shen , meanwhile, listened for whispers of the murderer among the merchants of Torg\u2019s . The trio joined in a game of cards, wagering gold for gossip \u2014 and though they won, their questions drew suspicion. When the traders made to leave, Higgens \u2019 whiskers twitched with mischief. A quick spell, a whispered word, and one of the merchants turned back with an unnaturally friendly smile. Under the charm, he revealed what the others would not \u2014 that Sephek Kaltro was indeed among them, sleeping in one of the rented rooms, his demeanor cold and eyes ever-glowing blue. Higgens , ever practical, also ensured her winnings were returned before the charm faded. The companions retired for the night, though none slept easily. Before dawn, they rose and crept toward Sephek\u2019s chamber. Yin Shen\u2019s deft hands found the lock pliant, and with a quiet click , the door swung inward \u2014 only to reveal an empty room, snow swirling through an open window. Without hesitation, they followed the trail into the blizzard. The footprints led them deep into a forest glade, where pines groaned under the weight of endless winter. There, bathed in moonlight like a phantom of the frost, stood Sephek Kaltro \u2014 his blade drawn, poised above a trembling Chwinga , one of the rare elemental spirits of Icewind Dale. The confrontation was swift and fierce. Magic sparked. Blades flashed. Aronious fought and was felled; Yin Shen\u2019s daggers danced like silvered shadows; Higgens unleashed bursts of flame, her tail whipping in delight and terror. Sephek moved with inhuman grace, his strikes fueled by something colder than hatred \u2014 until, at last, the light in his eyes dimmed. As his body fell, it melted into the snow, leaving behind only his blade \u2014 now shattered, yet alive with a darkness that drank the moonlight itself. The shards drew together, fusing into a dagger whose edge shimmered with an eerie, black anti-glow, as if even the darkness feared to touch it. Yin Shen reached for it, and though it burned cold in her palm, it did not harm her. The weapon pulsed once \u2014 as if recognizing her fallen divinity \u2014 and then fell silent.","title":"The Blade in the Snow"},{"location":"story/Session%201/#the-blade-in-the-snow","text":"The tale begins in the frozen town of Bryn Shander , where the wind never ceases and hope flickers like a dying hearth.
