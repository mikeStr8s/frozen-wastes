Within the stout walls of The Northlook Inn , travelers gathered to warm their bones and share rumor. Among them that night were three figures who, by fate or folly, would soon be bound by blood and ice. First was Aronious , a man of quiet strength \u2014 a ranger who once bore the light of the gods, now dimmed by his own choosing. He had walked the lonely paths of the tundra, seeking the freedom of one. That one was Yin Shen , a fox-spirited trickster of celestial origin \u2014 fallen, imprisoned, and marked by the goddess Auril\u2019s endless Rime . Now fallen and bound to mortal flesh, her golden eyes and sharp grin betrayed a spark of the divine mischief that had once lit the heavens. And lastly, there was Hobbins , scarcely taller than a sword, a ferret of remarkable intellect and no patience whatsoever. She claimed to be a wizard \u2014 and though many laughed, none laughed long once she\u2019d proven it. The three had scarcely entered The Northlook when their arrival drew the eye of Hiln Trollbane , a stout shield dwarf whose gaze carried the weight of suspicion and opportunity. When approached, she spoke of grim tidings \u2014 Over shared ale and cautious words, Hiln spoke of Sephek Kaltro , a blue-eyed killer she had stalked through Ten-Towns. He was said to be bound to Torg's Trading Company and to serve some darker purpose beneath the Frostmaiden\u2019s will. Sensing both coin and cause, the trio agreed to take up the hunt. They left Bryn Shander along the The Eastway , snow crunching beneath their boots and paws, until the lights of the Trail\u2019s End Tavern came into view. Within, the hum of travelers and traders mingled with the scent of wet wool and pine smoke. Aronious , ever cautious, circled the building, eyes sharp. He saw Torg\u2019s caravan settled within \u2014 ten rooms in all \u2014 and one, curiously, with its window unlatched and footprints fresh in the snow. Hobbins , ever the opportunist, made herself scarce and soon reappeared with a few extra coins jingling in her pouch. Yin Shen , meanwhile, listened for whispers of the murderer among the merchants of Torg\u2019s . The trio joined in a game of cards, wagering gold for gossip \u2014 and though they won, their questions drew suspicion. When the traders made to leave, Hobbins\u2019 whiskers twitched with mischief. A quick spell, a whispered word, and one of the merchants turned back with an unnaturally friendly smile. Under the charm, he revealed what the others would not \u2014 that Sephek Kaltro was indeed among them, sleeping in one of the rented rooms, his demeanor cold and eyes ever-glowing blue. Hobbins , ever practical, also ensured her winnings were returned before the charm faded. The companions retired for the night, though none slept easily. Before dawn, they rose and crept toward Sephek\u2019s chamber. Yin Shen\u2019s deft hands found the lock pliant, and with a quiet click , the door swung inward \u2014 only to reveal an empty room, snow swirling through an open window. Without hesitation, they followed the trail into the blizzard. The footprints led them deep into a forest glade, where pines groaned under the weight of endless winter. There, bathed in moonlight like a phantom of the frost, stood Sephek Kaltro \u2014 his blade drawn, poised above a trembling Chwinga , one of the rare elemental spirits of Icewind Dale. The confrontation was swift and fierce. Magic sparked. Blades flashed. Aronious fought and was felled; Yin Shen\u2019s daggers danced like silvered shadows; Hobbins unleashed bursts of flame, her tail whipping in delight and terror. Sephek moved with inhuman grace, his strikes fueled by something colder than hatred \u2014 until, at last, the light in his eyes dimmed. As his body fell, it melted into the snow, leaving behind only his blade \u2014 now shattered, yet alive with a darkness that drank the moonlight itself. The shards drew together, fusing into a dagger whose edge shimmered with an eerie, black anti-glow, as if even the darkness feared to touch it. Yin Shen reached for it, and though it burned cold in her palm, it did not harm her. The weapon pulsed once \u2014 as if recognizing her fallen divinity \u2014 and then fell silent.","title":"The Blade in the Snow"},{"location":"story/Session%201/#the-blade-in-the-snow","text":"The tale begins in the frozen town of Bryn Shander , where the wind never ceases and hope flickers like a dying hearth.

Yet one thing was amiss \u2014 Torg's Company was gone, their sleds and dogs no where to be seen. Left while the part was away. As they pondered their next course, the tavern door opened, letting in a gust of frost and a figure robed in rusty brown and red \u2014 Dzaan . His eyes sparkled with curiosity rather than menace, and a hint of a smile tugged at his lips. \u201cAdventurers, by the look of you,\u201d he said, striding to their table. \u201cI\u2019m conducting research on the elemental spirits that dwell in this land \u2014 Chwingas , I believe the locals call them. Elusive little things. I would pay handsomely for their study.\u201d Behind him, a companion in studded leather lingered at the doorway, but before the group could take a good look, the door shut and the figure was gone. Dzaan placed a small lantern of gentle blue fire upon the table. \u201cThis,\u201d he explained, \u201cis attuned to the spirits. It glows when they are near. Bring me one, and twenty-five gold is yours.\u201d Hobbins' eager chatter \u2014 and Yin Shen's foxlike grin \u2014 saw the wizard laugh and raise the offer. \u201cA fine bit of negotiation,\u201d he admitted, \u201cand a sign of capable company. Thirty gold pieces it is.\u201d The party accepted and returned to the forest, lantern in hand. There, beneath the whispering pines, they sought to coax the Chwingas from hiding. Remembering the tales that the spirits were fond of childish wonder, the group began to dance, sing, and play at circles in the snow \u2014 ring around the rosy beneath the moonlight. It was a comical sight: Aronious trying, with some dignity, to keep pace; Yin Shen spinning with genuine delight; and Hobbins darting through the snow like a ribbon of fur and laughter. Yet for all their effort, no spirit appeared. The lantern\u2019s flame flickered once, then stilled. With frost clinging to their cloaks and little gained for their play, they decided to continue their travels east to Easthaven . By the time they arrived, the sky was black and heavy with snow. The lamps of The White Lady Inn shone dimly through the storm \u2014 a welcome sight. Inside, warmth and music greeted them, and a bard named Rinaldo was making his rounds, filling the room with song and stories of the inn\u2019s spectral namesake. The trio took their rest there. The next day as they warmed themselves by the hearth, a bard named Rinaldo approached \u2014 a man of quick fingers and quicker tongue \u2014 proclaiming that he would hold a s\u00e9ance to summon the spirit of the inn\u2019s namesake, the White Lady who drowned long ago beneath the frozen lake. Yin Shen ventured into the square, where she stumbled upon a grim spectacle \u2014 Dzaan , the very wizard who had so warmly hired them, bound to a stake as the townsfolk gathered round. The flames climbed swiftly, and he met his end with unsettling calm. Beside Yin Shen stood Captain Imdra Arlaggath , the stern leader of Easthaven\u2019s guard. Seeing her disquiet, the captain muttered, \u201cDo not pity him, stranger. He murdered those he hired \u2014 folk of Icewind Dale \u2014 after they aided his travels. He\u2019s reaping what he sowed.\u201d When the captain turned her questioning gaze to Yin Shen, the rogue answered plainly that she and her companions had only crossed Dzaan\u2019s path briefly, and were in fact hunting Sephek Kaltro , the killer who had plagued Ten-Towns. Hearing that the murderer was no more, the captain\u2019s demeanor softened. \u201cYou\u2019ve a sharp eye and a steady hand,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve fishermen gone missing out on the ice. Find them, and what Dzaan carried in life shall be yours in death.\u201d The reward, as it turned out, included a Scroll of Fireball and a curious Gray Bag of Tricks , both lightly scorched from the pyre. Meanwhile, Aronious and Hobbins visited The Wet Trout , a lively and unruly tavern favored by miners and sailors. Hobbins, ever adventurous, sampled the local drink and promptly discovered the limits of a ferret\u2019s fortitude \u2014 one glass of clear liquor was quite enough. She spent the evening regretting it, and the next morning regretting it still. Aronious lingered at the bar, ever the quiet observer, and learned of other troubles. Between the shouting, dice, and spilled ale, he learned of a missing iron shipment meant for Blackiron Blades of Bryn Shander. The dwarves bringing it from the mines at Kelvin's Cairn had been attacked by a yeti , and the load lost in the mountains. The smiths offered gold for its return \u2014 and friendship besides, which for a dwarf is often worth more. He returned to the inn that night, where Hobbins was recovering and Yin Shen shared what she had learned. Aronious raised an eyebrow at mention of Dzaan\u2019s fate but said little. The wizard\u2019s soul was no longer their concern. As the night drew on, Yin Shen attended Rinaldo\u2019s s\u00e9ance, curious to see what spectacle the bard would conjure. Aronious, wary of dealings with spirits, remained upstairs, tending to a restless Hobbins and the fire that kept the cold at bay. Downstairs, the candles dimmed as Rinaldo began his performance, voice weaving through false prayers and soft illusions. Yet something unexpected happened \u2014 the air shifted, colder, real. The candles guttered, and from the center of the room a thin wisp of silver smoke coiled upward, forming the faint outline of a woman\u2019s face. Her whisper was no trick of thaumaturgy. \u201c Caer-Dineval . \u201d And then she was gone. Rinaldo, pale and trembling, ushered the guests out at once. Yin Shen lingered. A single glance from her foxlike eyes and a few sharp words were enough to draw the truth from him: his s\u00e9ances had always been performances , harmless illusions meant to entertain. But this time, what he summoned had answered him. When she finally returned upstairs, the lantern Dzaan had given them hung by the window, glowing faintly in the dark. The Chwingas had not shown themselves \u2014 yet perhaps, in their own way, they had been watching all along.","title":"The Many Whispers in Easthaven"},{"location":"story/Session%202/#the-many-whispers-in-easthaven","text":"When the travelers returned to the Trail's End Tavern , the night was calm and cold, and the road behind them lay silent.
